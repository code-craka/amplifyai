üîÆ Future Roadmap (Next Phases of Development)
This section outlines the next logical steps to evolve the platform, based on the amplifyai_roadmap.md plan.

Phase 6: Activating the Content (Publishing & Credentials)
[ ] Platform API Credential Management: Build a "Settings" page for users to securely connect their social media accounts to AmplifyAI using OAuth 2.0. This is the final piece required for the existing publish-post function to work.

Phase 7: Commercialization & Go-to-Market Prep
[ ] Define Pricing & Subscription Tiers: Establish feature limits for Free, Pro, and Agency plans and build the UI to display them.

[ ] Integrate Stripe for Subscriptions: Add a full billing system for users to subscribe to paid plans.

[ ] Implement Usage Limits & Metering: Modify create-brief to check against plan limits before generating content.

[ ] Create User Onboarding Flow: Guide new users through creating their first brand and campaign.

Phase 8: V2 Features & Future Growth
[ ] Enhance Analytics Dashboard: Augment the existing dashboard by fetching and displaying post-performance metrics (likes, comments) from social APIs.

[ ] Implement Team & Workspace Features: Adapt the schema and RLS to allow multiple users per account for agencies.

[ ] Clerk Authentication (Postponed): As originally discussed, evaluate and potentially implement Clerk for advanced enterprise-level user management features.

Phase 9: Enterprise Security & Compliance (Recommended Next)
[ ] Implement GitHub Enterprise Cloud: Upgrade to enterprise-grade security and compliance features.

[ ] Set up CI/CD Pipeline: Automated testing, security scanning, and deployment workflows.

[ ] Add Pre-commit Hooks: Prevent sensitive data commits with automated security scanning.

[ ] Implement SAML/SSO: Enterprise authentication for team access and security.
